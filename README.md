Lotus Select
------------

Lotus select is a nice replacement for the html select. It adds some small benefits over the select element.

1. One thing that I always hated with select was the space. It always takes longest element space on the document. With this new select plugin the space is restricted to the option item that is displayed.
2. We have lot of options to change the settings.
3. User can search through the list of options.
